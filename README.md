## Installation

Follow these steps to get your project up and running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git)
    cd your-project-name
    ```

2.  **Install Composer dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Set up your environment file:**
    Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Open the `.env` file and configure your database connection settings:
    ```dotenv
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
    DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
    ```

4.  **Generate the application key:**
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

5.  **Migrate the database and seed (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate --seed
    ```
    (Use `--seed` if your project includes seeders)
    (Use `php artisan migrate:refresh --seed` if your database exists)


6.  **Install Node modules:**
    ```bash
    npm install # Or yarn install
    ```

7.  **Compile frontend assets:**
    For production build:
    ```bash
    npm run build 
    ```
    For development (watch mode):
    ```bash
    npm run dev 
    ```

8.  **Start the Laravel development server:**
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

9.  **Storage Link:**
    ```bash
    php artisan storage:link
    ```

Now, you should be able to view the project in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (or the URL shown by `php artisan serve`).
